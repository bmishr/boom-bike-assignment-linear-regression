## BoomBikes Sharing-Linear-Regression-Assignment
> A Multiple Linear Regression Assignment with RFE and MinMax Scaling
 
## Introduction
This assignment involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The submission requires a Jupyter notebook documenting the process.
 
## Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system allows individuals to use bikes for short-term periods. BoomBikes, a US provider, has faced revenue declines during the COVID-19 pandemic. To prepare for post-lockdown market recovery, they aim to understand bike demand factors:
- Identify significant variables predicting bike demand.
- Assess how well these variables describe demand.
 
### Business Goal
The goal is to model shared bike demand using available independent variables. This model will guide business strategies to meet demand, align with customer expectations, and understand dynamics in a new market.
